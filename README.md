# WT32-SC01-PLUS with LVGL 9.1

This is a very good starting point for using Panlee's WT32-SC01-PLUS with PlatformIO using the Arduino framework !
It shows how to initialize the screen and creating some LVGL-widgets.
Simple, but working "out-of-the-box".

For a more complex use-case got to https://github.com/DrNeuroSurg/TINYRadio9

# Used libraries:
LVGL V 9.1
LoyanGFX
