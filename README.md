# WT32-SC01-PLUS with LVGL 9.1

This is a very good starting point for using Panlee's WT32-SC01-PLUS with PlatformIO using the Arduino framework !
It shows how to initialize the screen and creating some LVGL-widgets.
Simple, but working "out-of-the-box". With this configuration it is possible to get around 30 FPS !
